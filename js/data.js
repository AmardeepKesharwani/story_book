    <h2>A Friend</h2>
    <p>I'd Never gave much thought while writing this story ,it is more like a description of a friend.but since I decided to write one let's go with the flow and see how it turns out. </p>
    <p>What's is one of the biggest arising problem of our society? Everyone would have different thoughts about this, but for me the answer will be depression and anxiety. And also because you don't know how a person feels ,thinks and going through. Overcoming it is the biggest achievement you could ever have.</p>
    <p>I met that person not too long ago. But we became really good friends. And having good and trustworthy friend is what you all need.</p>
    <p> Finding a true friend feels like a gift that keeps on giving, even when they are thousands of miles away. Through stressful classes, figuring out a career and whenever you are stuck in something  your best friends have been there. And yes,</p>
    <p> when you got those bangs you shouldn’t have tried in the first place, they consoled you. Whether you’re celebrating life or happen to experience an unexpected bump, you can always rely on your friends to be there for you. A listening ear, a shoulder to cry on, or finding the silver lining in a less than ideal situation — all of it means the world to you simply knowing you have your friends supporting you every step of the way.<br/>
    Anything is possible when you have the right people there to support you. Share your smile with the world.</p>

    <p>Whenever I would see him he would always seem happy, cheerful and a carefree soul. He always like to help others and feels really happy to do so. Whoever asks him to anything he would do it happily. He is really good friend like  whom everyone wants to have one. A friend on whom you can always rely on and who is always there for you.</p> 
    <p><i>You may look happy to others.
    may laugh at jokes, dance with others, sing along to songs, but inside, you still feel sad. Internally, you still feel lifeless.</i></p>
    <p> But we don't know what a person thinks and what he/ she is going through . We can only see what they show us. And all things can't be told </p>

    <p><i>The prettiest smile hides the deepest secrets. The prettiest eyes have cried the most tears. And the kindest heart have felt the most pain</i> </p>
    <p> And  still if someone helps others selflessly in such situation and just want to be happy for them is really a great thing. Even if people don't tell you everything , they are going through a lot. They hide all the things </p>
    <p> Even if people don't tell you everything , they are going through a lot. They hide all the things from because they don't want to envolve you in anything and just want you to be happy. </p>
    <img src='https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTrlR8x9U3mt7e0KpI0u_L8ZQ4wyZvltCYxbQ&usqp=CAU' alt="" />
    <p>Whenever I used to see him I knew he was going through alot but he was still trying to be happy in front of others. And it requires alot. Everyone just need someone to share everything and talk to. Someone who understand them, trust them and can be with you everytime even if no one does. And a best friend is all you need .</p>
    <p><i>Sometimes when I say “I’m OK”, I need someone to look me in the eyes, hug me tight and say “I know you are not"</i></p>
    <img src='https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcThKX7uskD90cw6DGqiWM3pRwIyTPdrvVd4-w&usqp=CAU' alt="" />
    <p>A friend always help you to overcome loneliness and depression.I really admire my friend. However he is, he is still the best. His kind, polite, sweet , caring and stupid personality.</p>
    <p> He has all what you want to have in your friend. Even if he doesn't top the class and isn't the favorite student of all the teachers in school. He is still the most intelligent student who just loves to gain knowledge and marks doesn't matter to him. He likes talking to people who is close to him and can talk to them all day long.And he would do everything for them. And he is still the best even if he doesn't think so. He don't know how good he is. And he truly values friendship</p>
    <p>I just wish him that he always stay happy because he deserves to be. And I hope he really becomes selfish one day.and He will always be my "Bevkuf" ,"Ullu" And "Na layak" Friend.</p>

      <h2>Humble Upbringing</h2>
      <p>Born on July 12, 1972 in Madurai, Sundar Pichai hails from a middle-class Tamil family. His father Regunatha Pichai, worked as an electrical engineer for GEC and managed a factory that made electrical components. His mother used to be a stenographer before having Pichai and his younger brother. The Pichai home during Sundar’s young days was a two-room apartment. Like any Indian middle-class family in the 80s, even to buy a scooter Pichai’s father had to wait for three years</p>
      <h2>Pichai’s Love For Technology As A Child</h2>
      <p>Early on, Pichai understood how technology could save a lot of time as he recounted in an interview. When his mother was sick once, he had to travel to a very far off place to collect blood reports for her. It took him more than an hour to reach the place and he had to wait at the centre for hours. This annoyed him and when the family bought their first rotary telephone, he valued it a lot, since with one phone call he would know when reports would arrive. <br/>He was also intrigued by the refrigerator his family bought.</p>
      <h2>An Excellent Student</h2>
      <img src='https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcSUC2vzuSULvVHOhkmOSAKLUo_wK1D8gnV5XQ&usqp=CAU' alt="" />
      <p>His family realised his skill to memorize a lot of things very early on. As a child Pichai would surprise everyone by remembering many phone numbers. He excelled in studies at his school Jawahar Vidyalaya in Chennai and earned a seat at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kharagpur, where he did his B.Tech in metallurgical engineering. <br/><br/>During the course he won a scholarship to study materials science and semiconductor physics from Stanford University from where he went on to complete his M.S.</p>
      <h2>The Google Journey Begins</h2>
      <p>Pichai joined Google as the President of product management in 2004. He was entrusted initially with Google Search toolbar which gave users of Internet Explorer and Firefox easy access to Google search. He also went on to work on many other important products like Google Gears, Gadgets, Google Pack, all of which are no longer available.</p>
      <h2>The Chrome Days</h2>
      <img src='https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTnYdZzOF6KyL0_5MDqxxNA2rwxxJpG-7ebNQ&usqp=CAU' alt=""/>
      <p>Then came the turning point in Pichai’s career and Google’s growth journey. Pichai came up with the idea of developing Google’s own browser. Though initially the idea was not encouraged by seniors, his perseverance and faith in his product convinced cofounders of Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, to launch Google’s own browser in 2008.</p>
      <h2>Time To Change Android</h2>
      <img src='https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcSv1i22_Hmw8At0EovZGE5EN-v4MYaiDQNDBQ&usqp=CAU' alt=""/>
      <p>In 2012, Pichai added another Google division to his portfolio and one year later he was taking care of running Android. Another important contribution from Pichai was Android One, low-cost smartphones. He also went on and took charge of search, maps, research, Google+, Android, Chrome, infrastructure, commerce and ads, and Google Apps. <br/><br/>Under Pichai, Android cemented its place as the world’s leading operating system and the CEO also managed to strengthen various weak points in Android’s architecture, from the point of view of security and integration of Google Assistant etc.</p>

      <p>“Sundar brings humility and a deep passion for technology to our users, partners and our employees every day. He’s worked closely with us for 15 years, through the formation of Alphabet, as CEO of Google, and a member of the Alphabet Board of Directors. He shares our confidence in the value of the Alphabet structure, and the ability it provides us to tackle big challenges through technology. There is no one that we have relied on more since Alphabet was founded, and no better person to lead Google and Alphabet into the future</p>

He tried calling him many times, but his partner had turned off the phone. He was never contacted by his partner but this didn’t make Sandeep Maheshwari upset. Instead, he went back home and waited for something important to happen in his life.</p>

     <h2>Birth And Upbringing</h2>
     <p>Narendra Modi, in full Narendra Damodardas Modi, (born September 17, 1950, Vadnagar, India), Indian politician and government official who rose to become a senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In 2014 he led his party to victory in elections to the Lok Sabha (lower chamber of the Indian parliament), after which he was sworn in as prime minister of India. Prior to that he had served (2001–14) as chief minister (head of government) of Gujarat state in western India.</p>

     <h2>Early Life And Political Career</h2>
     <p>Modi was raised in a small town in northern Gujarat, and he completed an M.A. degree in political science from Gujarat University in Ahmadabad. He joined the pro-Hindu Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) organization in the early 1970s and set up a unit of the RSS’s students’ wing, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, in his area. Modi rose steadily in the RSS hierarchy, and his association with the organization significantly benefited his subsequent political career</p>

     <p>Modi joined the BJP in 1987, and a year later he was made the general secretary of the Gujarat branch of the party. He was instrumental in greatly strengthening the party’s presence in the state in succeeding years. In 1990 Modi was one of the BJP members who participated in a coalition government in the state, and he helped the BJP achieve success in the 1995 state legislative assembly elections that in March allowed the party to form the first-ever BJP-controlled government in India. The BJP’s control of the state government was relatively short-lived, however, ending in September 1996</p>

     <h2>Political Ascent And Term As Chief Minister Of Gujarat</h2>
     <p>In 1995 Modi was made the secretary of the BJP’s national organization in New Delhi, and three years later he was appointed its general secretary. He remained in that office for another three years, but in October 2001 he replaced the incumbent Gujarat chief minister, fellow BJP member Keshubhai Patel, after Patel had been held responsible for the state government’s poor response in the aftermath of the massive Bhuj earthquake in Gujarat earlier that year that killed more than 20,000 people. Modi entered his first-ever electoral contest in a February 2002 by-election that won him a seat in the Gujarat state assembly</p>

      <h2>Hamare Pyaare Mark Bhaiya</h2>
      <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
      <p>Mark Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York, and was raised in nearby Dobbs Ferry.1﻿ He was born into a well-educated family and developed an interest in computer programming at an early age.</p>
      <p>At the age of 12, Zuckerberg created a messaging program named Zucknet that he implemented as an inter-office communication system for his father's dental practice.2﻿ Due to his early signs of success, his parents got him a computer programming tutor while he was still in high school, and they enrolled him in a prep school in New Hampshire. After graduating from prep school, Zuckerberg enrolled at Harvard University</p>
      <h2>Success Story</h2>
      <p>While many intelligent people attend Harvard University, Mark Zuckerberg became known quickly as the go-to computer programmer on campus. By his sophomore year, he had already built two programs: CourseMatch and FaceMash.2﻿ Both programs became wildly popular, but the university shut down the latter program after it was deemed to be inappropriate.</p>

      <p>Based on his acclaim on campus, Zuckerberg partnered with friends to create a social networking site that allowed Harvard students to connect with each other. The site officially went live in June 2004 under the name "The Facebook," and Zuckerberg ran it out of his dorm room.<br/>After his sophomore year, Zuckerberg dropped out of college to pursue what was now called Facebook, full-time. The website reached one million users by the end of 2004</p>

      <p>In April 2018, Zuckerberg testified before Congress after it was revealed that the company had shared users' data with the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.10﻿ Forbes has credited the quick drop of Facebook’s stock price following the company's July warning to investors of slowing growth and profit margins to the growing impact of the battle between profit and privacy, citing the Cambridge Analytica story and Facebook's growing inability to protect users from harmful misuse and misinformation.</p>

     <h2>Useful tips to help you create good habits as a web developer</h2>
     <p>This article is aimed at junior developers, but may interest anyone as a bank of useful tips on how to grow some good habits. <br/>I’m constantly trying to challenge myself and get out of my comfort zone. Here is the summary of the best daily tips I came up with. <br/>I try to perfect my working habits as I’m growing, so feel free to suggest some tips not specified in this article to help me too</p>
     <img src='https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcRVsV7S_1X-2pOtifx0QrG22n2MogZ9IwafSQ&usqp=CAU' alt="" />
     <h2>Do technology watch. A LOT</h2>
     <p>There’s not a lot more to say, but in my opinion, it’s the easiest way to learn just by reading. Even if you don’t understand the whole subject or learn how to do the magic thing the article talks about, you know that it exists. And that’s what really matters. <br/>A lot of services and tools are now available online to help you do this. You should use them because they’ll be your first source of information and new ideas on a daily, weekly or monthly basis.</p>
     <img src='https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcSZ_KVWvDhmvWGq08MkFD8DRsEjAsyq9ND3fg&usqp=CAU' alt="" />
     <h2>Look at awesome websites. And unpack them</h2>
     <p>Ask yourself: how you would do the magic, and try to understand what they used to build it. New technology, new JavaScript library, unknown CSS property? We live in a world where every day new things come up and we are not able to learn as fast as the technologies grow themselves. <br/>But I would suggest that you not only try to understand the process but also try to reproduce it, and explain it. Generally, if you can teach to someone, you have mastered the subject.</p>

     <h2>Learn from those with more experience</h2>
     <p>Usually when you start as a junior in a company, you’ll be directed by a Lead Dev who will have a look at your code, schedule your tasks, and prevent you from dropping the database. <br/>Don’t be shy to ask to learn more from them. Ask them to show you how to do the cool things they did on the last website they launched, or the nice component they made to make the life easier for everyone on the dev team. <br/>But most important: don’t be afraid to ask for things you think are dumb.</p>
     <h2>NEVER, EVER, forget to comment your code</h2>
     <p>Ok, I know, you’ve read that sentence a million times since you started coding. On the internet, by your superiors, by your teachers, even maybe by your dog. <br/> <br/>The point of commenting your own code isn’t to make it only easily understandable by another developer or yourself. It’s also a way to think about your function before writing it. To define a purpose. And only one.</p>`
